# software-security-design
As a junior,I have finished the course named software security design,which required us to design a project with GUI detecting attacks based on API hook.Despite that it is a simple project without sopishticated design,for me,it is first whole project I have accomplished.So I share with you guys the happiness I enjoyed.
